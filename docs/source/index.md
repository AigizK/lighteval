# üå§Ô∏è Lighteval

A lightweight framework for LLM evaluation

LightEval is a lightweight LLM evaluation suite that Hugging Face has been
using internally with the recently released LLM data processing library
datatrove and LLM training library nanotron.

We're releasing it with the community in the spirit of building in the open.

Even though it has been used in a variety of projects, keep in mind that parts
of lighteval are still unstable and might break ! In case of any problem or
question, feel free to open an issue.
