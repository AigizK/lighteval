A lightweight framework for LLM evaluation

LightEval is a lightweight LLM evaluation suite that Hugging Face has been
using internally with the recently released LLM data processing library
datatrove and LLM training library nanotron.

We're releasing it with the community in the spirit of building in the open.

Note that it is still very much early so don't expect 100% stability ^^' In
case of problems or questions, feel free to open an issue!
